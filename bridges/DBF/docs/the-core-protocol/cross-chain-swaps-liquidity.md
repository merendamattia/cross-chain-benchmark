# Cross-Chain Swaps Liquidity

## **Provision of liquidity for cross-chain pools at Curve**

deBridge is a decentralized infrastructure that is fully composable with the existing DeFi ecosystem. That‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need to do our own AMM or DEX, but just create different liquidity pools for deAssets in existing DEXes. In every blockchain supported by deBridge, there will be a liquidity pool for deUSDC at Curve or protocols that support the concept of the stable swap.

Cross-chain swaps is one of the applications built on top of deBridge infrastructure that enables users to perform swaps from any asset on one chain to any asset on another.

Here are the instructions on how to deposit liquidity into the pool for each blockchain/L2.
