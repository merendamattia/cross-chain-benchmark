Proxy to execute the other contract calls.
This contract is used when a user requests transfer with specific call of other contract.

# Variables

## DEBRIDGE_GATE_ROLE
```solidity
  bytes32 public constant DEBRIDGE_GATE_ROLE;
```
Role allowed to withdraw fee
## submissionChainIdFrom
```solidity
  uint256 public submissionChainIdFrom;
```
Chain from which the current submission is received
## submissionNativeSender
```solidity
  bytes public submissionNativeSender;
```
Native sender of the current submission

# Functions
## initialize
```solidity
  function initialize(
  ) public
```




## call
```solidity
  function call(
            address _reserveAddress,
            address _receiver,
            bytes _data,
            uint256 _flags,
            bytes _nativeSender,
            uint256 _chainIdFrom
  ) external returns (bool _result)
```

Used for calls where native asset transfer is involved.

### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`_reserveAddress` | address | Receiver of the tokens if the call to _receiver fails
|`_receiver` | address | Contract to be called
|`_data` | bytes | Call data
|`_flags` | uint256 | Flags to change certain behavior of this function, see Flags library for more details
|`_nativeSender` | bytes | Native sender
|`_chainIdFrom` | uint256 | Id of a chain that originated the request

## callERC20
```solidity
  function callERC20(
            address _token,
            address _reserveAddress,
            address _receiver,
            bytes _data,
            uint256 _flags,
            bytes _nativeSender,
            uint256 _chainIdFrom
  ) external returns (bool _result)
```

Used for calls where ERC20 transfer is involved.

### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`_token` | address | Asset address
|`_reserveAddress` | address | Receiver of the tokens if the call to _receiver fails
|`_receiver` | address | Contract to be called
|`_data` | bytes | Call data
|`_flags` | uint256 | Flags to change certain behavior of this function, see Flags library for more details
|`_nativeSender` | bytes | Native sender
|`_chainIdFrom` | uint256 | Id of a chain that originated the request

## multiSend
```solidity
  function multiSend(
            bytes transactions
  ) external
```
The code is for most part the same as the normal MultiSend (to keep compatibility),
        but reverts if a transaction tries to use a delegatecall.
This method is payable as delegatecalls keep the msg.value from the previous call
        If the calling method (e.g. execTransaction) received ETH this would revert otherwise
Sends multiple transactions and reverts all if one fails.

### Parameters:
| Name | Type | Description                                                          |
| :--- | :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|`transactions` | bytes | Encoded transactions. Each transaction is encoded as a packed bytes of
                    operation has to be uint8(0) in this version (=> 1 byte),
                    to as a address (=> 20 bytes),
                    value as a uint256 (=> 32 bytes),
                    data length as a uint256 (=> 32 bytes),
                    data as bytes.
                    see abi.encodePacked for more information on packed encoding


## receive
```solidity
  function receive(
  ) external
```




## _externalCall
```solidity
  function _externalCall(
            address _destination,
            uint256 _value,
            bytes _data,
            bytes _nativeSender,
            uint256 _chainIdFrom,
            uint256 _flags
  ) internal returns (bool result)
```




## _customApprove
```solidity
  function _customApprove(
            contract IERC20Upgradeable token,
            address spender,
            uint256 value
  ) internal
```




## version
```solidity
  function version(
  ) external returns (uint256)
```
