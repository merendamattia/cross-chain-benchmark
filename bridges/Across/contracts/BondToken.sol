 * into the Across v2 HubPool contract. When configured as the required HubPool bond token, ABT can dramatically reduce
 * the attack surface of the HubPool by requiring that addresses are explicitly approved before they can successfully
 * submit a root bundle proposal. The address-based permissioning does not constrain transfers that are needed to dispute
 * a root bundle proposal, so the ability of decentralised/unknown actors to dispute is unaffected.
