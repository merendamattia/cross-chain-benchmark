/**
 * @notice Contract containing logic to send messages from L1 to "L3" networks that do not have direct connections
 * with L1. L3's are defined as networks that connect to L1 indirectly via L2, and this contract sends
 * messages to those L3's by rerouting them via those L2's. This contract is called a "Router" because it uses
 * (i.e. delegatecall's) existing L2 adapter logic to send a message first from L1 to L2 and then from L2 to L3.
 * @dev Due to the constraints of the `SetCrossChainContracts` event as outlined in UMIP-157 and how the HubPool
 * delegatecalls adapters like this one, all messages relayed through this
 * adapter have target addresses on the L3's. However, these target addresses do not exist on L2 where all messages are
 * rerouted through. Therefore, this contract is designed to be used in tandem with "L2 Forwarder Adapters" which help
 * get the messages from L1 to L3 via L2's.
 * @dev Public functions calling external contracts do not guard against reentrancy because they are expected to be
 * called via delegatecall, which will execute this contract's logic within the context of the originating contract.
 * For example, the HubPool will delegatecall these functions, therefore its only necessary that the HubPool's methods
 * that call this contract's logic guard against reentrancy.
